# mastermind

Note:
1) mastermind.py and words.txt should be in the same directory to play. If you want to change which words the default mode will pick from for greater letter overlap etc., just create a new words.txt file with your own curated words.
2) When running in the terminal, you can use CLI args "--manual" and "--easy"
to turn on manual mode (you can input your own words instead of using the dictionary, great for 2 players since it clears the screen after input) and easy mode (shows exactly which letters were guessed correctly instead of just giving a count).
3) You can pick the length of the words, how many guesses you get, and how many words there are. You can make it basically impossible to lose, but don't be surprised if it's not very satisfying!
4) Every game should have something fun hidden inside. ;)
